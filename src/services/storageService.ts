// This file previously contained Cloudinary-specific code for image uploads and management.
// It has been cleared as part of the migration to GitHub avatars and letter avatars.
// New avatar-related services (e.g., for fetching GitHub avatars) might be added here
// or in a new dedicated service file like `avatarService.ts`.

// Placeholder for any future generic storage utilities if needed.
// For now, it's intentionally left mostly empty.

export {}; // Ensures the file is treated as a module if no other exports are present.
